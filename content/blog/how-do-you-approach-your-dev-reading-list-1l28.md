I have noticed that when faced with articles that are either long, or likely to be useful in the future, people tend to add them to their reading list.

I am curious about how do you use this list. Do you set a time during the week when you go through it and read what you have saved during the last days?

Do you use it as a sort of library, where you can go and search for answers on interesting topics whenever the need comes?

Personally, I am guilty of saving cool stuff in my reading list but then never going back to it, so I am looking for tips on how to optimize this behavior and take advantage of the awesome content I save.
