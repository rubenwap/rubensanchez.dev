      <description>Glad to see you back. It means that you liked the previous part of this article. Or if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, please check it out.
I would like to continue the series by explaining about some more dubious techniques I was using during my first dev job. I hope you can find some advice and good tips from reading it!
Bad dependencies So in that first job, we were very keen on researching new cool tools.</description>

      <description>I got my first developer job almost by accident. I was not looking for a dev job back then, but while I was working doing something else, some tools I had developed as work side project got some traction and I was able to get an offer from the same company to move into a position to develop full time.
That was pretty cool! But looking back, I did things that would send shivers down the spines of security professionals, devops guys and other kinds of reasonable people.</description>
