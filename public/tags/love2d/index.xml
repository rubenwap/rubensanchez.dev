      <description>So I admit it, I always wanted to create a game, but I have been too easily scared by the amount of work that seemed to be required to delve into something like Unity. I did some easy attempts at HTML canvas based Javascript games, but nothing impressive enough. Although if you are so inclined, do check the great PhysicsJS library and you might end up creating something cool.
Then my quest had a clear goal: Be able to make a cool game with the most minimal amount of effort possible.</description>
