      <description>I have to admit I am far from expert in Scala, that&amp;rsquo;s why when recently I had to prototype an API in this language, I shuddered. Frameworks like Akka HTTP or HTTP4S were far too complex for a novice in the field like me, because learning Scala is not about the syntax, but about the mindset. And it&amp;rsquo;s only logical that someone coming from the field of totally different languages such as Python or Javascript, can have a little trouble understanding concepts like the actor model or the functional proper way of using HTTP4S.</description>
