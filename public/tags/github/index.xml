      <description>Creating a well tested application pays off by having a lot less to debug in the future, together with the peace of mind that you can refactor your application as much as you want and nothing is going to break because the tests would alert you quickly if that happened. Automating your deployment will also pay off, not only because it will save you a ton of clicks (or commands) but because it will prevent errors and your builds will be predictable.</description>
