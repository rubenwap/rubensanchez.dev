      <description>I have noticed that when faced with articles that are either long, or likely to be useful in the future, people tend to add them to their reading list.
I am curious about how do you use this list. Do you set a time during the week when you go through it and read what you have saved during the last days?
Do you use it as a sort of library, where you can go and search for answers on interesting topics whenever the need comes?</description>
